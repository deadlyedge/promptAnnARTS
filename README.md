# Made for fun

This project is made for fun. promptAnnARTS is about arts and nothing about nvidia's RTS. Of course you should have a RTS to run stable diffusion, but that's not the point, the point is I'm learning react and typescript.

When I swim in the sea of Stable Diffusion, I got good pictures accidentally, I want to remember the good things and forget the bad, so I made this little app for help.

It could help you either, I hope.

# Just a simple prompt tool

it can show your stable diffution prompts store in png files, and you can select them to make new ones.

I'm just work on stable diffution webui for only hours, so I may find something new, worth to add to my little program.

it's tiny and may you enjoy it:)
